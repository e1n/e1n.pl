      - name: "Centralized Job Dispatcher (CJD)"
        description: | 
          Came with idea / design and implementation of Workday's Job Framework new feature - Centralized Job Dispatcher (CJD).<br />
          Purpose of CJD is to provide a unified way to manage incoming Job requests to the system.<br />
          It aims to solve the problem of multiple entry points for Job requests and provide a single point of control for all Jobs dispatch.<br /><br />
          As a result of CJD implementation we have achieved following benefits:<br />
            - Improved system performance and scalability by optimizing Job dispatching and resource allocation.<br />
            - Proper throttling of incoming Job requests to prevent system overload and ensure smooth operation.<br />
            - Better job balancing across available processing nodes.<br />
            - Elimination of transactional update conflicts related to Sequential Execution guardrail resolution.<br />
            - Enhanced monitoring and logging capabilities for better visibility into Job processing and troubleshooting.<br />
            - Greatly Simplified codebase as was able to shrink its size by 20-30% overall !<br />
            - Simplified OPS and support processes by providing a single point of control for Job dispatching and management.<br />

      - name: "Remote Partition Processing (RPP)"
        description: |
          Aim of this project was to horizontally scale processing of Workday's Job Framework tasks to idle servers in a cluster.<br />
          Feature came to existence as a result of cluster usage metrics analysis and finding out that <br /> 
          often there is spare processing capacity on some servers while others are overloaded.<br /><br />
          Key pillars of RPP implementation were: <br />
            - Job Load protocol exposing information about cluster nodes capacity.<br />
            - API to distribute tasks between cluster nodes.<br />
            - Monitoring layer to intelligently cancel remote tasks when host node is getting its own dedicated traffic.<br />
          Results achieved by RPP implementation were: <br />
            - Improved system performance and scalability by optimizing Job processing and resource allocation across cluster nodes.<br />

      - name: "Auto Triage Tool (ATT)"
        description: |
          ATT is a standalone CLI tool designed to automate process of log collection and analysis for many Workday's frameworks and services. <br /> <br />
          It collects structure and unstructured logs from various sources like: <br />
            - Elasticsearch, <br />
            - TeamCity, <br />
            - Jenkins, <br />
            - E2 instances, <br />
            - Stats Warehouse <br />
            - local env.<br />
          Then it presents it in a user-friendly way as a report with insights and recommendations for next steps. <br />
          This tool quickly became a go-to tool for Workday's support and SRE teams to troubleshoot issues faster and more efficiently. <br />

      - name: "Adaptive Dynamic Partitioning (ADP)"
        description: |
          One of the problems of batch processing frameworks within transactional systems is related to chunking step input <br /> 
          If input is too small we might have too many small tasks / transactions which can lead to significant overhead and performance degradation. <br />
          On the other hand if input is too big we might have long running tasks / transactions which can cause starvation of other tasks and lead to increased latency and reduced throughput. <br />
          ADP is a feature that dynamically adjusts partition / chunk sizes based on real-time data characteristics and processing requirements. <br />
          It aims to optimize performance and resource utilization by adapting partitioning approach to changing conditions. <br />
            Results achieved by ADP implementation were: <br />
                - Improved system performance and scalability by optimizing partitioning and resource allocation based on real-time data characteristics and processing requirements.<br />
                - Reduced latency and increased throughput by dynamically adjusting partition sizes to prevent starvation of other tasks and ensure efficient processing.<br />
                - Better fairness among tasks scheduled to run from different Jobs.<br />
